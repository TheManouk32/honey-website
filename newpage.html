    <h3>Our Honey is absolutely the best tasting you'll ever try. Why? 3 Reasons:</h3>

    <ol>
 	  <li>It's never heated, only strained to remove any particles</li><br>
 	  <li>It's all sourced locally right on-site our ranch in Southern California</li><br>
 	  <li>We offer a variety of flavors to choose due to our bees foraging on a variety of floral sources</li><br>
    </ol>

    <p>Our grandfather, Pietro Manouk, began tending bees in 1968, learning from the pioneers of the trade in Southern California. He passed his knowledge down to his son Alonzo Manouk, who established a thriving business raising queen and package bees for beekeepers and honey producers across the nation.</p>

    <p>We grew up in the family business, constructing bee boxes, maintaining hives and driving bee trucks down in the orange orchards as soon as we could see over the dashboard and reach the pedals. We accompanied our grandfather out to the fields as he cared for the bees, and we learned firsthand the importance of happy & healthy bees.</p> 

    <p>Through our parents' business was solely about the bees, the honey needed to be tended to. One of our jobs as kids was to fill jars, and year after year, we observed that well-cared-for bees produced not only more honey but better quality honey.</p>

    <p>Manoukâ€™s Honey evolved from that experience. We care for our own bees, and we still fill every jar ourselves, so we know that the honey we produce is the best it can possibly be. Our grandfather Pietro taught us that; We could never imagine doing things any other way.</p>
